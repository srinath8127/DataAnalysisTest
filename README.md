DataAnalysis In this SQL Project for Data Analysis, I'll will efficiently leverage various analytical features and functions accessible through SQL in PostgreSQL

## What is the Agenda of the project?

The project’s Agenda involves Analyzing the data using **SQL** on the **PostgreSQL**. We first download the **PostgreSQL** from the official PostgreSQL website and understand the problem. Then a Password is set up for the “postgres” username during the setup of **PostgreSQL** software. Then SQL Plus is used to connect to **pgadmin** using the same credentials of the **PostgreSQL**. 

Further, a Database connection is established from pgadmin to the **PostgreSQL** using the “postgres” username and the password. Then tables are created in the database followed by data insertion into tables and exploration, i.e., 

## Todo:

Noticing relationships between tables, walking through the columns, and seeing comments. 
Records are displayed in an ordered manner, handling NULL values, and selecting records based on patterns like Wildcard, Operators, etc. 
Then working on Data Manipulation commands(DML) for Data Analysis. 
Then taking Backup of the Table where migration is going on and use COMMIT and ROLLBACK commands. 
Then listing down distinct records, further renaming columns, and finally, listing down employee details based on the complex nested conditions.
