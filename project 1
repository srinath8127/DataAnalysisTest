---i had worked as a SQL developer and data analyst for a online products retail company.
---i used to help sales and marketing team to analyise the sale and inventory
---As e-commerce experiences remarkable growth around the world,
---the application allows the customer to register and buy an item using the internet.
---The registration process typically involves the generation of a unique customer ID and password and in many cases,
---consolidates information like Name, Address, Contact Information etc.

---Once a user purchases a product, a bill is generated based on the price, and discount, if any.
---The customer has to choose a payment method to settle the transaction before it is delivered to the selected location.

### Agenda of the project###
---The projectâ€™s Agenda involves Analyzing the data using SQL on the postgreSQL
noticing relationships between tables, walking through the columns,
and seeing comments. Records are displayed in an ordered manner, handling NULL values,
and selecting records based on patterns like Wildcard, Operators, etc.
Then working on Data Manipulation commands(DML) for Data Analysis.
then taking Backup of the Table where migration is going on and use COMMIT and ROLLBACK commands.
Then listing down distinct records, further renaming columns, and finally,
listing down employee details based on the complex nested conditions.


#### Order by
--The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default.
--To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.

select productname, supplierid, productid
from products
order by productid

## like  and where
--The LIKE command is used in a
--WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.
--You can use two wildcards with LIKE : %

select productname, supplierid, productid
from products
where productname like '_c%'

##delete
---- The DELETE command is used to delete existing records in a table.
DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Alfreds Futterkiste';

##distinct
The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.
SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;

## NULL function

---NULL is used in SQL to indicate that a value doesn't exist in the database.

SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + UnitsOnOrder)
FROM Products;

## IN
---The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE Country IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');
