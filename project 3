####Introduction

---i had worked as a SQL developer and data analyst for a online products retail company.
---i used to help sales and marketing team to analyise the sale and inventory
---As e-commerce experiences remarkable growth around the world,
---the application allows the customer to register and buy an item using the internet.
---The registration process typically involves the generation of a unique customer ID and password and in many cases,
---consolidates information like Name, Address, Contact Information etc.

---Once a user purchases a product, a bill is generated based on the price, and discount, if any.
---The customer has to choose a payment method to settle the transaction before it is delivered to the selected location.

### Agenda of the project
--- tThis projectâ€™s Agenda involves Analyzing the data using SQL onhe postgreSQL.
---This project involves the data analysis using Sub-query, Group-by clause and Exists clause.
---It also consists of using inline view and aggregate functions(Min, Max, Count, Avg)
---to perform better analysis on data.

### Sub-query
A Subquery or Inner query or a Nested query is a query within another SQL query



## group by
select c.categoryname , sum(unitsinstock) as total_unitsinstock
from categories c inner join products p on c.categoryid = p.categoryid
group by c.categoryname
having sum(unitsinstock)>500

## Min
The MIN() function returns the smallest value of the selected column.

select c.categoryname , min(unitsinstock) as min_unitsinstock
from categories c inner join products p on c.categoryid = p.categoryid
group by c.categoryname
having min(unitsinstock)>0

## Max
The Max () function returns the largest value in the seleced column

select productid, categoryid, max(unitprice)
over(PARTITION by categoryid) as unitprice
from products

##Count
The COUNT() function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criterion.

select productid, orderid, count(quantity)
over(partition by orderid) as count_quantity
from order_details

## Avg
The AVG() function returns the average value of a numeric column
