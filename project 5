#### project agenda
This project involves data analysis using different SQL functions like ROW_NUMBER,
RANK, DENSE_RANK, SUBSTR, INSTR, COALESCE and NVL. It also involves the use of some built-in
functions like concat, upper, lower, initcap, rtrim, ltrim, length, lpad, rpad.

ROW_NUMBER
Numbers the output of a result set. More specifically, returns the sequential
number of a row within a partition of a result set, starting at 1 for the first row in each partition.

SELECT
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY customerid ASC) AS Row,
  contactname , companyname, contacttitle, customerid
FROM customers

RANK AND DENSE_RANK
Ranking functions return a ranking value for each row in a partition.
Depending on the function that is used, some rows might receive the same value as other rows.
Ranking functions are nondeterministic.


SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname
    ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY e.hiredate) AS "Row Number"
    ,RANK() OVER (ORDER BY e.hiredate) AS Rank
    ,DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY e.hiredate) AS "Dense Rank"
    ,o.orderid
    ,e.hiredate
	,o.customerid
FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN orders o
        ON e.employeeid = o.employeeid

##CONCAT
The CONCAT() function adds two or more expressions together.

SELECT CONCAT(address ||' ' ||  postalcode || ' ' ||  city) AS address,
contactname, companyname, customerid, contacttitle
FROM customers;

##TRIM
The TRIM() function removes the space character OR other specified characters from the start or end of a string.

select upper(concat(firstname,' ',lastname)) as fullname,
trim(concat(firstname,' ',lastname))
as fulllname from employees
